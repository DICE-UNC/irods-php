##PHP API for iRODS

###NOTE: this is currently transitional, and at release time will represent the next canonical release of PHP.

We're moving to gitHub off of [GForge] (https://code.renci.org/gf/project/irodsphp/).  For previous releases, GForge is still canonical, but from this piont forward, GitHub will contain the most current snapshot activity and shold be used going forward.

Community contribution of PHP code is most welcome.  Drop us an issue or pull request if you want to pitch in.
